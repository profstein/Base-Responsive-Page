# Base-Responsive-Page
This page is intended to demonstrate a basic responsive web page. While it can work on a production site, it is not aimed at production-ready sites but for use in teaching responsive web design.

## Projects Used
This page inlcudes files from a number of other projects:

1. Modernizr: https://modernizr.com
2. Selectivizr: http://selectivizr.com/
3. jQuery: https://jquery.com/
4. Normalize: https://necolas.github.io/normalize.css/

It also owes a inflential debt to HTML 5 Boilerplate. This is in some ways a simplified version that is less daunting to use directly from GitHub.
